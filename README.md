Property Pulse is a real estate [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) type rental website where users can browse, search and manage property listings.

- Sharing property on social media
- User authentication with Google & Next Auth

- Creating user profile with all his property listings
- Internal messaging system
- Maps and geocoding
- Toast notifications
- Photoswipe image gallery

- User profile with user listings
- Property image upload (multiple)
- Cloudinary integration
- Server actions & database interaction (as database app uses Atlas which is a cloud version of MongoDB)
- Responsive design (Tailwind)
- Custom 404 page and loading spinners

Some app pages are server rendered and some are statically generated (Next.js is used for both server side rendering and as static site generator).

Project uses NPM as package manager.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
